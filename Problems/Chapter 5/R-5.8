R-5.8

	Q: 

	Give a complete/precise definition of the concept
	of matching for grouping symbols in an
	arithmetic expression.

	A:

	In C++, arithmetic expressions have an 'operator precedence'
	from left-to-right : multiplication, division, remainder, addition, & subtraction.

	Arithmetic expressions can contain various pairs of grouping symbols
	such as:
		Parentheses: "(" and ")"
		Braces: "{" and "}"
		Brackets: "[" and "]"
		Floor function symbols
		Ceiling function symbols

	Correct use in an arithmetic expression:

	(((((a * b) / c) % d) + e) - f)
