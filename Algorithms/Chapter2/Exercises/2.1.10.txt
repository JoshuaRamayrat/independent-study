Question:
	Why not use selection sort for h-sorting in shellsort?

Notes:
	Shellsort is an extension of insertion sort.
		Allows exchanges of entries that are far apart.
		Produces partially sorted arrays for insertion sort to perform on.

		Taking every 'hth entry' yields a sorted subsequence.
		The entire array is called 'h-sorted'.
		'h-sorted' array is h independent subsequences interweaved together.

Answer:
	We don't use selection sort because it's not making use of 
	array entries that are far apart. Selection sort goes through
	every entry until the smallest one. H-sorting skips array entries
	to increase the efficiency of insertion sort.
