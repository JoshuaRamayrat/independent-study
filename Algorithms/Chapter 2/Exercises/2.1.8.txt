Question:
	An array with 1 of 3 elements.
	Insertion sort is performed.
	What is the runtime? (i.e. linear -> quadratic)

Answer:
	Insertion sort should still be O(n^2) 
	in the worst case and O(n) in the best case.

	The array only having 1 of 3 elements shouldn't 
	affect the way the algorithm sorts through it.
