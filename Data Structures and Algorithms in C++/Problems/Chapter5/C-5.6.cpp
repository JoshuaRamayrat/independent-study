	Q:
	An n * n 2-dimensional array 'A' is used to store integers.
	We don't want an O(n^2) algorithm to initialise all elements to 0.

	Show an implementation of an array-based stack S storing
	integer triples (i,j,k) to allow us to use the array A
	w/out initializing it and still implement our algorithm
	in O(n) time.
