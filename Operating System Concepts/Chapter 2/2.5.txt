2.5 What is the purpose of the command interpreter?
    Why is it usually separate from the kernel?

    	The command interpreter allows users to enter commands
	to be performed on the OS

	The main function of the interpreter is to get and 
	execute the next user-specified command.

	The command interpreter is not part of the kernel
	because it can change to read different commands.
