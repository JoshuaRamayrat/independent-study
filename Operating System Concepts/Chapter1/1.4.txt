    	This depends on your definition of an OS. If an OS is just
	the kernel, then web browsers aren't part of the OS as a kernel
	is designed to "manage a computer's hardware". The web browsers
	and mail programs are "application programs". They don't have
	to exist for the computer to work. 

	You could argue they're part of the OS as OSs provide the 
	environment for application programs to exist. As a result,
	the application program is part of the OS.
