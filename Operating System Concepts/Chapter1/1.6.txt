1.6 Which of the following should be 'privileged'?
	set value of a timer
	read the clock
	clear memory
	issue a trap instruction
	turn off interrupts
	modify entries in device-status table
	switch from user to kernel mode
	access i/o device

	(My answer)
	Privileged instructions are 'harmful' if they're
	modified by the user:
		set value of a timer
		clear memory
		issue a trap instruction
		turn off interrupts
		switch from user to kernel mode
		access i/o device
