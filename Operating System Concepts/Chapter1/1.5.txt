1.5 How does the distinction between kernel mode and user mode 
    function as a rudimentary form of protection (security) system?
	
	(My answer)
    	There are internal applications running that should not be
	disrupted by the user for the operating system to function
	correctly. In user mode, the available graphical interfaces
	prevent the user from accessing critical applications.
