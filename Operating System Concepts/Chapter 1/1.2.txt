1.2 We have stressed the need for an OS to efficiently use hardware.
    When is it okay to 'waste' resources and why is such a system
    not really 'wasteful'?

	(My answer)
    	It's okay to use resources for the view of the User. The user
	should have access to the keyboard, mouse, system unit, and
	several applications running all at the same time. It would 
	be hard on the user to have to wait for any single process 
	to complete. This is a design for 'ease of use'. No attention
	is paid to 'resource utilization'.
