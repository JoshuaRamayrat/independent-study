Content of the book

- organized into 8 MAJOR PARTS
	
	Overview: 

	- what operating systems are, 
	- what they do, 
	- how they are designed and constructed. 
	- operating systems for PC, server, & mobile devices.
	

	Process management

	- CH3-7
	- process conept & concurrency as the heart of modern OS.
	- process: unit of work in a system
	- system consists of a collection of concurrently executing
	  processes
	  	- some are os processes. execute system code
		- some are user processes. execute user code
	- methods for 
		- process scheduling
		- interprocess communication
		- process synchronization
		- deadlock handling
	- thread discussion and multicore system & parallel prog issues


	Memory management

	- CH8-9
	- managing main memory during process exec. 
	- computer must keep several processes in memory
		- for improving CPU utilization and user response speed.
	- many different memory-management schemes
		- algorithm effectiveness depends on situation


	Storage management

	- CH10-13
	- how to handle 
		- mass storage
		- file system
		- I/O
	- file system- mechanism for storing/accessing data/programs.
	- there are algorithms and structures for storage management.
	- properties, advantages, disadvantages of algorithms
	- I/O devices attaching to a computer vary widely
		- operating system neds to provide a wide range
		  of functionality to applications to control 
		  all aspects of the device
	- I/O devices are the slowest major component.
		- they represent a 'performance bottleneck'
		- performance issues with I/O devices examined
	- also discussed:
		- system I/O
		- I/O system design
		- interfaces
		- internal system structures
		- internal system functions


	Protection and Security
	
	- CH14-15
	- mechanisms for protection/security of computer systems
	- process activities must be protected from one another.
	- processes with proper authorization can:
		- operate on files
		- operate on memory
		- operate on the CPU
		- operate on other resources
	- "protection": mechanism for controlling the access of
		- programs
		- processes
		- users to computer-system resources.
	- must be specified:
		- controls to be imposed
		- means of enforcement.
	- "security" in this context:
		- protects integrity of information
		  stored in the system (data & code)
		- physical resources of the system
		  from unauthorized access, malicious destruction, 
		  & accidental inconsistency
	

	Advanced topics
	
	- CH16-17
	- 'virtual machines' and 'distributed systems' discussed
	- CH16: relationship of VM's to OS's.
		- hardware and software techniques to make 
		  virtualization possible.
	- CH17: distributed computing

	
	Case studies

	- CH18-19
	- Appendices A & B
	- real operating systems
		- Linux
		- Windows 7
		- FreeBSD
		- Mach
