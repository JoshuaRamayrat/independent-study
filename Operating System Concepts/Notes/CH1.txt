Introduction

- operating system: program to manage a computer's hardware
	- intermediary btwn user and computer hardware
	- combination of convenient and efficient
- system structure
	- system startup
	- I/O
	- storage

- large & complex so it's created piece-by-piece.
	- each piece is a well-delineated portion of the system
	- carefully defined inputs, outputs, and functions

- major components of computer system
- OS functions

- data structures in OS
- computing environments
- open-source OS's

1.1 What Operating Systems Do

- computer system is divided into 4 components:
	- hardware
	- operating system
	- application programs
	- users

- basic computing resources for system
	- hardware
		- central processing unit (CPU)
		- memory
		- input/outut (I/O) devices
- ways in which resources are used to solve problems
	- application programs
		- word processors
		- spreadsheets
		- compilers
		- Web browsers
- operating system controls hardware
- OS coordinates use among programs/users
- OS is analogous to a government
	- provides 'environment' for other programs to do work

1.1.1 User View

- OS for a user: monitor, keyboard, mouse, system unit
	- for ease of use
