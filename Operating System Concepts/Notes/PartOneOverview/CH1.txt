Introduction
- operating system: program to manage hardware
	- intermediary btwn user and hardware
- system structure:
	- system startup
	- I/O
	- storage

- large & complex so it's created piece-by-piece
	- each piece is a well-delineaed portion of the system
	- carefully defined inptus, outputs, & functions

- major components of a computer system
- OS functions

- data structures in OS
- computing environments
- open source OS's

- Abstract view:

1.1 What Operating Systems Do

- computer system divided into 4 components
	- hardware
	- operating system
	- application programs
	- users

- basic computing resources for system
	- hardware
		- central processing unit (CPU)
		- memory
		- input/output (I/O) devices

	- ways in which resources are used to solve problems
		- application programs
			- word processors
			- spreadsheets
			- compilers
			- web browsers
	- operating system controls hardware
	- OS coordinates use among programs/users
	- OS is analogous to a government
		- provides 'environment' for other programs to work

1.1.1 User View

- OS for a user: monitor, keyboard, mouse, system unit
	- for 'ease of use'

- other cases - users sit at workstations
	- connected to other workstations/servers
	- users have dedicated resources
	- share resources such as:
		- networking
		- servers
		- file servers
		- computer servers
		- print servers

1.1.2 System View

- OS: program most intimately involved w/ hardware
- OS is a 'resource allocator'
- OS manages resources
	CPU time
	memory space
	file-storage space
	I/O devices
	...
- different view - OS needs to control I/O devices and user programs.
	- 'control program'
		- manages user prog. execution
		- operation/control of I/O devices

1.2 Computer-System Organization

- computer system structure must be known before it's way of operation

1.2.1 Computer-System Operation

- general purpose computer:
	- 1+ CPU
	- # of device controllers
		disk drive
		audio device
		video displays
	- common bus to access shared memory
- initial program to start when computer is powered up
	- called a 'bootstrap program'
	- stored in hardware
		read only memory
		electrically erasable programmable read only memory
			"firmware" umbrella term
- bootstrap program must locate the OS kernel and load it into memory
- post-kernel locating
	- 'system programs' outside of the kernel are loaded 
	  into memory at boot time
	- called 'system processes' or 'system daemons'
		- runs the entire time the kernel is running
	- on 'UNIX', the first process is 'init'.
		- init starts other daemons.
	- after the call to 'init', the system is fully booted.
	- system waits for events to occur.
- occurence of an event is signaled by an 'interrupt'
  from either the hardware or software. 
	- hardware interrupt: signal sent to CPU
	- software interrupt: system call/monitor call (special operation)

- process followed for interrupts:
	- CPU is interrupted
	- CPU transfers execution to a fixed location
	- the 'fixed location' contains a starting adress
		- address contains 'service routine' for the interrupt.
	- interrupt service routine (ISR) executes
	- upon completion of ISR, CPU resumes interrupted computation
- 

1.11.8 Real-Time Embedded Systems

- most prevalent form of computers
- found everywhere:
	car engines
	manufacturing robots
	DVDs
	microwave ovens

- specific tasks
- usually little or no user interface
- monitors and manages hardware devices
	automobile engines
	robotic arms

- embedded systems vary considerably
	- general-purpose computer with Linux OS
	- special-purpose embedded OS with just functionality

- hardware devices with application-specific integrated circuits
  ASICs to perform tasks without an OS

- computerizing an entire house
	heating control
	lighting control
	alarm system
	coffee maker
	refrigerator

- embedded systems always run on 'real-time operating systems'
	- rigid time requirements on processor operation and data flow
	- sensor data to computer
	- computer analyzes data and adjusts control of sensor input

- examples of real-time systems
	- systems controlling scientific experiments
	- medical imaging systems
	- industrial control systems
	- display systems
	- automobile-engine fuel-injection systems
	- home-appliance controllers
	- weapon systems

- real-time system: well-defined, fixed time constraints
	- processing done within time constraints.
	- only functions correctly if results are delivered in time. 

- CH6: scheduling facility to implement real-time functionality in an OS
- CH9: memory management design for real-time computing.
- CH18-19: real-time components for Linux and Windows7 OS.
